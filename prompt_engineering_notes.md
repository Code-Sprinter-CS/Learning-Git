# Prompt Engineering Strategies for LLMs

Prompt engineering is a critical skill in getting the most out of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4, Claude, and Gemini.

## Types of Prompts

- **Zero-shot Prompting**: No examples provided.
- **Few-shot Prompting**: Includes a few demonstrations of the task.
- **Chain-of-Thought Prompting**: Encourages reasoning by explicitly requesting step-by-step output.
- **Role-based Prompting**: Assigns a persona or role to the model (e.g., "You are a legal assistant...").

## Use Cases

- Text summarization
- Code generation
- Data extraction
- Dialogue generation
